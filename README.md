Questions file is a text file contains questions that are got from the SQL zoo website if you don't understand the questions please follow [this link](https://sqlzoo.net/) and find the question from there for better understanding.

## About the SQL Zoo
SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions. Some of the queries, particularly at first, are quite simple. They definitely get more challenging towards the end and can be real head-scratchers.
